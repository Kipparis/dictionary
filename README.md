# Purpose
You want to practice foreign languages.  

# Why not just write in notebook
The program will store your results in database for long period. You may
train specific category, or train words which you stored, but never
trained (never used them).  
**_Shortly_**: you'll have more options of learning. Put yourself in a
difficult situation to learn more.  

# How many dependencies
You must have **_python_**.  
`python` dependencies are collected in [reqs.txt](https://github.com/Kipparis/dictionary/blob/master/reqs.txt)
file, which will install database tools ([peewee](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee)).
